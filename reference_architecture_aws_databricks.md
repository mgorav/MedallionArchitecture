  subgraph Raw_Data_Zone
    rd1[Raw Data 1] --> |Ingestion Services| S3_Raw[Amazon S3 Raw Zone]
    rd2[Raw Data 2] --> |Ingestion Services| S3_Raw
  end

  subgraph Trusted_Data_Zone
    S3_Raw --> |Orchestration Services| S3_Trusted[Amazon S3 Trusted Zone]
  end

  subgraph Refined_Data_Zone
    S3_Trusted --> |Orchestration Services| S3_Refined[Amazon S3 Refined Zone]
  end

  subgraph Delta_Lake
    S3_Refined --> |Processing Services| Delta[Delta Lake]
  end

  subgraph Unity_Catalog

  end

  subgraph Databricks
    Cluster[Databricks Clusters] --> |Processing Services| Notebooks[Databricks Notebooks]
    Notebooks --> |Processing Services| Jobs[Databricks Jobs]
  end
```

### Logical Data Flow
- Raw data from various sources is ingested into the Raw Data Zone using Ingestion Services, including Kinesis Streams, Kinesis Firehose, and S3 Batch Operations.
- Orchestration Services, such as AWS Step Functions and AWS EventBridge, manage the movement of data from the Raw Zone to the Trusted Zone and then to the Refined Zone in Amazon S3.
- Data processing tasks are executed on Databricks Clusters, orchestrated by Databricks Notebooks and Jobs.
- The processed data is stored in Delta Lake and cataloged in Unity Catalog for governance and discovery.

## Networking Design
```mermaid

    subgraph VPC_1
      A[Private Subnet 1] --> |Private Links| S3_Raw[Amazon S3 Raw Zone]
      B[Private Subnet 2] --> |Private Links| S3_Trusted[Amazon S3 Trusted Zone]
    end

    subgraph VPC_2
      C[Private Subnet 3] --> |Private Links| S3_Refined[Amazon S3 Refined Zone]
    end
  end

  subgraph On-Premises
    OP[On-Premises Data] --> |Ingestion Services| A
    OP --> |Ingestion Services| B
  end

  subgraph Databricks_Cluster
    Cluster[Databricks Clusters] --> |Processing Services| S3_Raw
    Cluster --> |Processing Services| S3_Trusted
    Cluster --> |Processing Services| S3_Refined
  end

  subgraph Databricks_Notebooks
    Notebooks[Databricks Notebooks] --> |Processing Services| Delta[Delta Lake]
    Notebooks --> |Processing Services| Catalog[Unity Catalog]
  end
```

### Networking Details
- Private Subnet 1 and Private Subnet 2 in VPC_1 are used to securely connect to Amazon S3 Raw and Trusted Zones, respectively, using Private Links. This ensures data privacy and security.
- Private Subnet 3 in VPC_2 connects to Amazon S3 Refined Zone via Private Links for secure data transfer.
- On-Premises Data sources connect to AWS via Ingestion Services, including Kinesis Streams, Kinesis Firehose, and S3 Batch Operations.
- Databricks Clusters securely access data in S3 Raw and Trusted Zones for processing.

The Medallion architecture offers a seamless and secure data processing solution, combining the scalability of AWS and the data processing capabilities of Databricks while ensuring data privacy and governance through Private Links.

## Federated Setup

Creating a detailed guide for setting up a federated AWS cross-account setup using multiple Databricks workspaces, along with the implementation of Unity Catalog, involves several intricate steps. This guide will be structured into three main sections: logical design, conceptual design, and network design, with each section containing a diagram for visual representation.

### 1. Logical Design

The logical design will outline the architecture and the components involved in the setup. Key elements include:

- **Multiple AWS Accounts**: Each account hosts its own resources and Databricks workspaces.
- **Databricks Workspaces**: These are set up in each AWS account, allowing for data processing and analytics.
- **Unity Catalog**: A unified data management system that provides a consistent view of data across different Databricks workspaces.

#### Logical Design
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[AWS Account 1] -->|Databricks Workspace| B((DB Workspace 1))
    A -->|Unity Catalog| C((Unity Catalog))
    D[AWS Account 2] -->|Databricks Workspace| E((DB Workspace 2))
    D -->|Unity Catalog| C
    F[AWS Account 3] -->|Databricks Workspace| G((DB Workspace 3))
    F -->|Unity Catalog| C
```

### 2. Conceptual Design

In the conceptual design, we will focus on the data flow and management aspects:

- **Data Sharing and Access Control**: How data is shared between different Databricks workspaces and managed via Unity Catalog.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensuring data governance and compliance across the federated setup.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Unity Catalog] -->|Manages| B(Data Access)
    A -->|Controls| C(Data Sharing)
    A -->|Enforces| D[Security & Compliance]
    E[DB Workspace 1] -->|Access| A
    F[DB Workspace 2] -->|Access| A
    G[DB Workspace 3] -->|Access| A
```

### 3. Network Design

The network design will cover the connectivity and security aspects:

- **VPC Peering or Transit Gateway**: To connect different AWS accounts and their resources.
- **Security Groups and Network ACLs**: For managing network traffic and access control.

#### Network Design
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AWS Account 1 VPC] -->|Peering/Transit Gateway| B[AWS Account 2 VPC]
    B -->|Peering/Transit Gateway| C[AWS Account 3 VPC]
    A -->|Security Groups/NACLs| D[DB Workspace 1]
    B -->|Security Groups/NACLs| E[DB Workspace 2]
    C -->|Security Groups/NACLs| F[DB Workspace 3]
```

### Additional Details

- **AWS IAM Roles and Policies**: Define and manage access policies for cross-account access.
- **Encryption and Data Protection**: Implement encryption both in-transit and at-rest for data security.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Use AWS CloudWatch and Databricks monitoring tools for operational visibility.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup AWS Accounts**: Create and configure AWS accounts, VPCs, and IAM roles.
2. **Deploy Databricks Workspaces**: Each AWS account should have its Databricks workspace set up.
3. **Configure Unity Catalog**: Set up Unity Catalog in Databricks

### Multiple IAM Policies Setup
In a federated AWS environment with multiple Databricks workspaces, it's crucial to establish robust IAM policies to manage permissions and access control effectively. These policies determine how users, services, and applications interact with AWS resources.

### Key Components:

1. IAM Roles and Policies for Each AWS Account: Unique roles and policies should be defined in each AWS account to control access to resources, including Databricks workspaces.
2. Cross-Account Access Management: IAM roles can be set up to allow users from one AWS account to access resources in another account, which is essential for a federated environment.
3. Fine-Grained Access Control in Databricks Workspaces: Policies should also extend to managing access within Databricks, controlling which users can access specific datasets, notebooks, and other resources.
4. Integration with Unity Catalog: IAM policies should align with the Unity Catalog's governance model to manage data access across different workspaces consistently.
